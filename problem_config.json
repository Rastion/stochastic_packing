    "description": "In the stochastic packing problem, items with random weights (sampled over several scenarios) must be partitioned into bins. For each scenario, the weight of a bin is computed as the sum of the weights of the items assigned to it. The objective is to minimize the 90th percentile (9th decile) of the maximum bin weight over all scenarios, thus building a robust solution that avoids risky scenarios without being overly pessimistic.",
